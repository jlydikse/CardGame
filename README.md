# Overview

{I am trying to create a working skeleton code for my card game, Dagee.}

{I used C# to code this card game, Dagee, because I wanted to try out a different language than I am used to, but also because I know C# is known for being an Object-Oriented Programming language. This is not a finished product at all, but just what I was able to accomplish for the past 2 weeks. Think of this as the first update to the overall project.}

{I mainly wanted to challenge myself and solidify some of my learning that I've been able to acquire over the past couple of years. I created this card game a while back with the youth I work with in my church, and I wanted to provide them a playable version of it. Again, this is a work in progress, but I hope to make this a fully playable game soon.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{I used the programming language of C# in order to complete this project, along with lots of other tools and libraries. The IDE I used was Visual Studio Code, and I was able to utilize the .NET framework, which allows cross-platform compatibility, so that this should be able to run on different types of operating systems.}

{Libraries Used: System.IO(for writing to and reading from text files), System.Threading (In order to use the Sleep method), Random Class(shuffling the deck of cards) and LINQ(sorting the cards randomly during the shuffle operation), Console (for reading and writing to the console)}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I need to make the game have actual logic on what the cards do
- I need to make the game go through an entire game, and not just stop after every player has played 1 card
- I need to create a better UI with pictures and things like that
